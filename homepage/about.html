                Introduction:
                In the CS50 course, I embarked on an exciting project called "Problem Set 8," where I had the opportunity to create a small website using HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap. The objective of this project was to showcase my understanding of web development fundamentals and apply them to construct an engaging and informative static webpage. In this essay, I will describe the process of creating the website, the challenges encountered, and the valuable skills acquired through this project.
            </p>
            <p>
                Website Concept:
                For my CS50 project, I designed a static website that serves as a platform to showcase my programming language skills acquired during the course. The website consisted of two main sections: a home page and a news portal. The home page provided a brief description of various programming languages I learned, such as Python, C, HTML, CSS, and more. The news portal featured static articles focused on technology and programming languages.
            </p>
                HTML and CSS:
                The foundation of the website was constructed using HTML, the markup language that structures web content. HTML provided the framework for organizing the website's components, such as headers, paragraphs, and lists. By utilizing semantic HTML tags, I ensured that the content was easily comprehensible to both users and search engines.
            <p>
                CSS was employed to style the website's elements, giving it an appealing visual design. By leveraging CSS selectors, properties, and values, I defined fonts, colors, margins, and other visual aspects. Additionally, I utilized Bootstrap, a popular CSS framework, to expedite the development process and create a responsive layout that adapted well to different screen sizes and devices.
            </p>
                Bootstrap:
                Bootstrap played a significant role in enhancing the website's design and responsiveness. By utilizing Bootstrap's pre-designed components and responsive grid system, I could easily create navigation bars, cards, and responsive layouts. The framework provided a consistent and professional appearance to the website without the need for extensive CSS customization. Moreover, Bootstrap's responsive features allowed users to access the website seamlessly from various devices.
            <p>
                Conclusion:
                Creating a static website for the CS50 project using HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap was an enriching experience. It allowed me to apply my knowledge of web development concepts and gain practical experience in designing and styling web pages. Through this project, I learned the importance of clean code structure, semantic HTML, and responsive design principles. I also developed skills in utilizing Bootstrap to enhance website aesthetics and responsiveness. Overall, this project served as a valuable stepping stone in my web development journey.
