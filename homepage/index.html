It was created in the 1970s by Dennis Ritchie, and remains very widely used and influential. By design, <b>C</b>'s features cleanly reflect the capabilities of the targeted CPUs. It has found lasting use in operating systems, device drivers, protocol stacks, though decreasingly for application software. C is commonly used on computer architectures that range from the largest supercomputers to the smallest microcontrollers and embedded systems. </p>

            <h3>Python</h3>
            <p><img src="//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0a/Python.svg/180px-Python.svg.png" alt="Python placeholder pic"> <b>Python</b> is a high-level, general-purpose programming language. Its design philosophy emphasizes code readability with the use of significant indentation via the off-side rule. Python is dynamically typed and garbage-collected. It supports multiple programming paradigms, including structured (particularly procedural), object-oriented and functional programming. It is often described as a "batteries included" language due to its comprehensive standard library. Guido van Rossum began working on Python in the late 1980s as a successor to the ABC programming language and first released it in 1991 as Python 0.9.0. Python 2.0 was released in 2000. <b>Python 3.0</b>, released in 2008, was a major revision not completely backward-compatible with earlier versions. <b>Python 2.7.18</b>, released in 2020, was the last release of <b>Python 2</b>.</p>

            <h3>HTML</h3>

It is often assisted by technologies such as <b>Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)</b> and scripting languages such as <b>JavaScript</b>. Web browsers receive <b>HTML</b> documents from a web server or from local storage and render the documents into multimedia web pages. <b>HTML</b> describes the structure of a web page semantically and originally included cues for its appearance.</p>

            <b>Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)</b> is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a document written in a markup language such as <b>HTML</b> or <b>XML</b>(including XML dialects such as SVG, MathML or XHTML). <b>CSS</b> is a cornerstone technology of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and JavaScript.</p>

            <h3>Javascript</h3>
            <p><img src="https://1000logos.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/JavaScript-Logo.png" alt="JS placeholder pic"> <b>JavaScript</b> (/ˈdʒɑːvəskrɪpt/), often abbreviated as <i>JS</i>, is a programming language that is one of the core technologies of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and CSS. As of 2022, <b>98% of</b> websites use JavaScript on the client side for webpage behavior, often incorporating third-party libraries. All major web browsers have a dedicated JavaScript engine to execute the code on users' devices. JavaScript is a high-level, often just-in-time compiled language that conforms to the ECMAScript standard.[10] It has dynamic typing, prototype-based object-orientation, and first-class functions. It is multi-paradigm, supporting event-driven, functional, and imperative programming styles. It has application programming interfaces (APIs) for working with text, dates, regular expressions, standard data structures, and the Document Object Model (DOM).</p>
