Questions:

Which predictions, if any, proved incorrect as you increased the number of simulations?:

After a certain amount of simulations the results got a far more stable and consistent but by googling the results of the world cup of 2018 of men it seems I am still away from a real algorithm that can fully predict the results.


Suppose you're charged a fee for each second of compute time your program uses.
After how many simulations would you call the predictions "good enough"?:

For the sake of accuracy I would choose 1000 simulations which seems to produce the most stable results for a very small cost in ms, after that, there is a large increase in the run time as it exponentially bigger.
